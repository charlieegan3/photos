Dad and I came back the old road after coop trip.\n\nThis the view from Easter Moniack looking west over what I'd have called the Strathconnon hills.\n\nI was annoyed that I'd not taken my moment lenses with my. I could have done with my 60mm for a shot like this. I've cropped out quite a bit of the boring field but I'd have liked a lot less - still, the best camera is the one you have with you... Also had few nice ones from a run around the woods with the dog but I opted for this one given I'm not likely to be back here before I head back down.\n.\n.\n.\n#traveling_uk #scenicbritain #LifeoftheUK #bbcbritain #scotland_greatshots #VisualsOfScotland #VisitScotland #lovescotland #traveling_scotland #instascotland #nationaltrustforscotland #thisisscotland #hiddenscotland #discoverearth #wonderful_places #rural_love #theglobewanderer #discoverglobe #fantastic_earth #awesome_earth #ourplanetdaily #osmaps #exploretocreate #instagoodmyphoto #watchthisinstagood #justgoshoot #peoplescreatives #shotbypixel #teampixel #nofilter",
