  "caption": "In the end, this is the only photo I've decided to post from hogmanay at Gallowhill. I took a long running one that didn't turn out as well as I expected.\n\nMost of the other ones didn't really have any star interest and instead just looked like noisy daytime shots. I quite enjoyed playing with the Photoshop B&W raw tools to bring out the plough in this one.\n\nThis is my first proper post of the year so I should outline my new rules for 2018.\n• Post photos within 24hrs of taking them\n• Post photos in the order they were taken\n• Square photos only - no videos or multi-photo posts\n• No 'overshare', leave an hour at least between posts\n\n#shotonmoment #teampixel #blackandwhite #astrophotography",
