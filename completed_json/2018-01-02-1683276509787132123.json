  "caption": "Last night was my second last night at home so, keen to get a picture of some nice star trails, I was out late again - this time armed with dad's tripod too.\n\nI pointed the camera approximately north so Polaris would be in the shot and left it running for 30 minutes. It was a lovely night but hanging around in the cold gets boring fast.\n\nThere were a lot more clouds than I'd have liked but with some clever photoshop blending I managed to get the trails singled out ok against the sky. This is based on 120 exposures at ISO 200.\n\n#scotland_greatshots #VisualsOfScotland #VisitScotland #lovescotland #traveling_scotland #instascotland #nationaltrustforscotland #thisisscotland #hiddenscotland #earthfocus #lifeofadventure #folkscenery #theoutbound #discoverearth #rural_love #theglobewanderer #discoverglobe #fantastic_earth #awesome_earth #ourplanetdaily #osmaps #exploretocreate #instagoodmyphoto #watchthisinstagood #justgoshoot #peoplescreatives #shotonmoment #shotbypixel #teampixel #nofilter",
