It takes a video, converts it to frames, aligns the frames to avoid shake/drift and averages them to create an interesting smoothing effect.\n\nThis photo was based on a short video clip I took while running to work.\n\nPreviously I needed to use Photoshop to make these images up - I've made that accessible from my phone; in the spirit of mobile photography and the best camera is the one you have with you etc etc.\n\nI also wrote a blog post about this...\n.\n.\n.\n#imagestack #thames #river #church #houseboat #water #blur #city #teampixel #shotonpixel #nofilter #citylife #nofilterneeded #building #bridge #riverthames #buildings #cityscape #boat #town #riverside #waves #architecturelovers #reflection #londoncity",
