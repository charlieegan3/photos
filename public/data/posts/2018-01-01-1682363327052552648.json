{"caption":"Walking up to the top of Gallowhill Wood is my new favorite walk and I managed to sell it as a good firework-viewpoint.\n\nI took quite a few photos which I've yet to edit but since I started 2017 with a photo of me taking photos I thought I'd start 2018 the same way. The only difference is that I took this photo, if you look closely, you can see the strap of the remote shutter dangling from my right hand.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\n#shotonmoment #teampixel","code":"BdY9IhMHJnI","dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cc3bb5b373bee20ff95f00ae98910556/5B0D2431/t51.2885-15/e35/26151368_179524095970769_2588052691619938304_n.jpg","id":"1682363327052552648","is_video":false,"location":{"has_public_page":true,"id":"1033488271","name":"Redcastle","slug":"redcastle"},"media_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cc3bb5b373bee20ff95f00ae98910556/5B0D2431/t51.2885-15/e35/26151368_179524095970769_2588052691619938304_n.jpg","post_url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BdY9IhMHJnI","tags":["#shotonmoment","#teampixel"],"timestamp":1514773358,"FullID":"2018-01-01-1682363327052552648","lat":57.51312,"long":-4.36746,"location_count":37}
