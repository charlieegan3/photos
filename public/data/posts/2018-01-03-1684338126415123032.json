{"caption":"This track is just west of Spital Wood. I've walked past the end of it hundreds of times with the dog - we've been going that way for years - but have never actually gone down it. It doesn't really go anywhere other than to this little abandoned cottage (see next post)\n\nSunsets/Sunrises come and go so fast. I missed some wonderful red sky trying to get to the right spot yesterday morning so I was pleased to catch this nice evening sun before heading back down to the big smog tonight.\n\n#scotland_greatshots #VisualsOfScotland #VisitScotland #lovescotland #traveling_scotland #instascotland #nationaltrustforscotland #thisisscotland #hiddenscotland #earthfocus #lifeofadventure #folkscenery #theoutbound #naturephotoportal #discoverearth #wonderful_places #rural_love #theglobewanderer #discoverglobe #fantastic_earth #awesome_earth #ourplanetdaily #osmaps #igersmood #shotbypixel #teampixel #nofilter","code":"Bdf-JoantJY","dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/54b79d794b323f99bf7ceacdad1c3fba/5B19F888/t51.2885-15/e35/26072665_209613702945422_3991636759728357376_n.jpg","id":"1684338126415123032","is_video":false,"location":{"has_public_page":true,"id":"847544201","name":"Mulbuie","slug":"mulbuie"},"media_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/54b79d794b323f99bf7ceacdad1c3fba/5B19F888/t51.2885-15/e35/26072665_209613702945422_3991636759728357376_n.jpg","post_url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdf-JoantJY","tags":["#scotland_greatshots","#VisualsOfScotland","#VisitScotland","#lovescotland","#traveling_scotland","#instascotland","#nationaltrustforscotland","#thisisscotland","#hiddenscotland","#earthfocus","#lifeofadventure","#folkscenery","#theoutbound","#naturephotoportal","#discoverearth","#wonderful_places","#rural_love","#theglobewanderer","#discoverglobe","#fantastic_earth","#awesome_earth","#ourplanetdaily","#osmaps","#igersmood","#shotbypixel","#teampixel","#nofilter"],"timestamp":1515008773,"FullID":"2018-01-03-1684338126415123032","lat":57.5406396333,"long":-4.4284455333,"location_count":217}
