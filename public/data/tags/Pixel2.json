{"name":"Pixel2","posts":[{"caption":"I was hoping for something more interesting to end the year on but these Mulbuie cows will have to do.\n\nThis is it, the end of 2017 and the end of my #365photochallenge. I'm going to be making some changes to the rules tomorrow.\n\nI set out to post a photo every day to encourage me to get back into photography. In this sense I think it's been successful - thanks for putting up with it.\n\nI went from iPhone 6, to Sony RX100IV to Pixel 2 + #shotonmoment. There's no denying that the best quality photos came from the camera but I think the #Pixel2 is close enough for me. Also, with the moment superfish and wide lenses I can do more than I could with my camera anyway.\n\nI've been to Asturias, South Uist, Ireland and Budapest this year. Next year I'd like that list to be longer.\n\nI'll likely be doing a roundup of my favorites on my blog early in the new year. \nThe challenge stops here. The fear of not having a photo to post each day lead me to store up photos while on holiday and post them over the following month. This gives me lots of choice but ultimately makes for a slightly boring feed. When I did set the new rule at the beginning of this month to post photos only on the day they were taken I found that the quality suffered. I also found that while home for Christmas I'd have liked sometimes to post more than one photo per day. \nSo that's it.\n\n#traveling_uk #scenicbritain #LifeoftheUK #bbcbritain #scotland_greatshots #VisualsOfScotland #VisitScotland #lovescotland #traveling_scotland #instascotland #nationaltrustforscotland #thisisscotland #hiddenscotland #exploretocreate #instagoodmyphoto #watchthisinstagood #justgoshoot #peoplescreatives #nofilter","code":"BdX-nBXnuks","dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bce787fe158fc1426f6897ea91981ef5/5B28CA4C/t51.2885-15/e35/25036131_1493265604314322_3612126543146385408_n.jpg","id":"1682088346259482924","is_video":false,"location":{"has_public_page":true,"id":"847544201","name":"Mulbuie","slug":"mulbuie"},"media_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bce787fe158fc1426f6897ea91981ef5/5B28CA4C/t51.2885-15/e35/25036131_1493265604314322_3612126543146385408_n.jpg","post_url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BdX-nBXnuks","tags":["#365photochallenge","#shotonmoment","#Pixel2","#traveling_uk","#scenicbritain","#LifeoftheUK","#bbcbritain","#scotland_greatshots","#VisualsOfScotland","#VisitScotland","#lovescotland","#traveling_scotland","#instascotland","#nationaltrustforscotland","#thisisscotland","#hiddenscotland","#exploretocreate","#instagoodmyphoto","#watchthisinstagood","#justgoshoot","#peoplescreatives","#nofilter"],"timestamp":1514740578,"FullID":"2017-12-31-1682088346259482924","lat":57.5406396333,"long":-4.4284455333,"location_count":217},{"caption":"Putney's only yellow door\n·\n·\n·\n#putney #london #yellow #door #architecture #doorframe #house #houseofblues #nofilter #nofilterneeded #nofilters #latergram #colorful #picoftheday #Pixel2","code":"BcElNJXgXOo","dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e80f3c39b2c4c56dba9e9a4b05e30dcf/5B29706B/t51.2885-15/e35/24274782_1184218378389492_6058285764553211904_n.jpg","id":"1658614193911329704","is_video":false,"location":{"has_public_page":true,"id":"49143886","name":"Putney","slug":"putney"},"media_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e80f3c39b2c4c56dba9e9a4b05e30dcf/5B29706B/t51.2885-15/e35/24274782_1184218378389492_6058285764553211904_n.jpg","post_url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BcElNJXgXOo","tags":["#putney","#london","#yellow","#door","#architecture","#doorframe","#house","#houseofblues","#nofilter","#nofilterneeded","#nofilters","#latergram","#colorful","#picoftheday","#Pixel2"],"timestamp":1511942241,"FullID":"2017-11-29-1658614193911329704","lat":51.4611780318,"long":-0.2166802887,"location_count":46},{"caption":"This is my last photo from my Budapest trip for #euroku2017.  It's been over a month since I left and I've come to realise that holding out this long past the date of taking photos is cheating at my own game - where the game is to take more photos and post one each day of 2017.\n\nI've taken lots of photos since returning from Budapest and I'm going to post them throughout November to bring my feed into the present.\n\nIn December I'm going to trial my 2018 challenge early of taking at least one photo per day and posting it. This is going to be hard for holidays but I might post multiple times or use Instagram multi-image 'posts' to get around the issue.\n\nThere have been multiple cases this year where I've wanted to post a photo nearer the date it was taken - the U2 concert this summer was most frustrating - and I think it's time I made the feed closer to 'real-time'. I'm making this change after upgrading to a #Pixel2 and buying some #shotonmoment lenses. I thought I'd take my digital compact everywhere with me but the reality was that I didn't. Someone also asked if I'd moved to Budapest - I haven't - but the comment got me thinking!","code":"BbL8bevnDMF","dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9cb541ecc3a57122f6919cf36b168424/5B08CE54/t51.2885-15/e35/23347601_1485186241602641_1736767753823453184_n.jpg","id":"1642672260334236421","is_video":false,"location":{"has_public_page":true,"id":"150639","name":"Szimpla Kert","slug":"szimpla-kert"},"media_url":"https://scontent-lht6-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9cb541ecc3a57122f6919cf36b168424/5B08CE54/t51.2885-15/e35/23347601_1485186241602641_1736767753823453184_n.jpg","post_url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbL8bevnDMF","tags":["#euroku2017","#Pixel2","#shotonmoment"],"timestamp":1510041814,"FullID":"2017-11-07-1642672260334236421","lat":47.49697,"long":19.06328,"location_count":7}]}
